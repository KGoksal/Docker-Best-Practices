# Docker Best Practices

## Best Practice Rules
### 1. Use an official and verified Docker image as a base image, whenever available.
Instead of taking a base operating system image (like ubuntu) and installing node.js, npm and whatever other tools you need for your application, **use the official node image for your application.**
### 2. Use specific Docker image versions
So instead of a random latest image tag, you want to fixate the version and just like you deploy your own application with a specific version you want to use the official image with a specific version. 
-  **the more specific the better** Transparency to know exactly what version of the base image you're using

### 3. Use Small-Sized Official Images
When choosing a Node.js image, you will see there are actually multiple official images. Not only with different version numbers, but also with different operating system distributions. So pay attention to these:
-  **1) Image Size**
  In contrast having **smaller images** means you need **less storage** space in image repository as well as on a deployment server and of course you can transfer the images **faster when pulling or pushing** them from the repository.
-  **2) Security Issue**
-  In comparison by using smaller images with leaner OS distributions, which only bundle the necessary system tools and libraries, you're also **minimizing the attack surface and making sure that you build more secure images.**
-  = So the best practice here would be to select an image with a **specific version based on a leaner OS distribution like alpine** for example: Alpine has everything you need to start your application in a container, but is much more lightweight. And for most of the images that you look on a Docker Hub, you will see a version tag with alpine distribution inside.

### 4. OPTIMIZE CACHING FOR IMAGE LAYERS WHEN BUILDING AN IMAGE 
When you rebuild your image, if your Dockerfile hasn't changed, Docker will just use the cached layers to build the image.
**Advantages of cached image layers:**
- âœ… **Faster image building**
- âœ… **Faster pulling and pushing of new image versions:** Only the newly added layers will be downloaded, the rest are already locally cached by Docker.
- âœ… **Optimize the Caching**
- Order your commands in the Dockerfile from the least to the most frequently changing commands to take advantage of caching and this way optimize how fast the image gets built. ðŸš€

### 5. Use .dockerignore file
